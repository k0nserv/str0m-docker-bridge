#   AWS EC2:   PUBLIC_IP=54.123.45.67
#   GCP:       PUBLIC_IP=34.123.45.67

PUBLIC_IP=

# OPTIONAL: IP address to bind the UDP socket to
# Default is 0.0.0.0 which binds to all container interfaces
BIND_IP=0.0.0.0

#
# For cloud VMs (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.):
#   curl ifconfig.me
#   curl icanhazip.com
#
# For AWS EC2 specifically:
#   curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4
#
# For local development (get LAN IP):
#   Linux:   ip addr show | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
#   macOS:   ipconfig getifaddr en0
#   Windows: ipconfig | findstr IPv4
